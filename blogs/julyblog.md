# ECH Institute's July celebration 

The first half of 2025 has been a whirlwind of activity, and July was more special for our team! From producing fresh educational content to hosting online and in-person events, we’ve been deeply engaged with the community. Let’s take a moment to look back at what we created, the initiatives we led, and the ways we connected with and supported the Ethereum ecosystem this past month.

## ECH Institute Turns One 

We’re excited to share that ECH Institute has completed its first year of operation on July 11, 2025 as a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit in the United States!

With our mission of Education, Community Building, and Homesteading, we’re dedicated to advancing Web3 education through a variety of podcasts, as well as ensuring the availability of Ethereum Protocol meetings and related resources — welcoming women, underrepresented developers community, Ethereum enthusiasts, and aspiring devs from all backgrounds.

Our Annual Report offers a comprehensive look at the past year, featuring a Letter from the President, an introduction to our dedicated team, an overview of our mission and vision, and highlights of our key activities. You’ll also find insights into the programs, initiatives, and milestones that shaped our work—plus more stories and resources that reflect our commitment to education, community building, and the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Education

### Deep-diving into Fusaka upgrade proposals on PEEPanEIP

We were stoked to have [@optimizoor](https://x.com/optimizoor) and [@EthDreamer ](https://x.com/EthDreamer) to join us for our PEEPanEIP recordings. 

[@optimizoor](https://x.com/optimizoor) gave our audience an overview of the current state of Count Leading Zeros (CLZ) variants and what [EIP-7939](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7939) 'Count leading zeros (CLZ) opcode' hopes to achieve, through adding an opcode to count the number of leading zero bits in a 256-bit word.

In a separate podcast, [Mark Mackey](https://x.com/EthDreamer) covered EIP-7892: Blob Parameter Only Hardforks, a mechanism allowing core developers to adjust Ethereum’s blob capacity outside of network upgrades. The significance is that no code change is  required, only a config change, bringing greater flexibility and time saved.

- 2 FOCIL Breakout, 
- 1 All Core Devs Execution (ACDE), 
- 3 EIP Editing Office Hours and 
- 1 EIPIP Meeting. 

## Community Building

### Celebrating Ethereum's 10-year anniversary

ECH Institute is proud to have our team member [@cyph3rvae](https://x.com/Cyph3rVae) to co-host the Summer of Ethereum: Auckland Pit Stop event with [EthPanda](https://x.com/ETHPanda_Org), [LXDAO](https://x.com/LXDAO_Official) and [ETH Auckland](https://x.com/eth_auckland).

### 10 Year Anniversary Community Kahoot 

We also co-hosted the Dragon’s Den with [Nico](https://x.com/nicnode) from [Octant](https://x.com/OctantApp), bringing a special edition commemorating Ethereum’s past 10 years of growth. Both [Nico](https://x.com/nicnode) and [Cyph3rVae](https://x.com/Cyph3rVae) took a walk down memory lane, covering topics such as the mining of the genesis block, the DAO hack, NFT mania, ICO mania as well as the Merge.

## Homesteading Ethereum

### EIP Editing Support

We held and livestreamed **3 EIP Editing Office Hours** and **1 EIPIP Meeting**. 

Leading the EIP Editor’s leaderboard is ECHInstitute’s team member, [@g11tech](https://x.com/g11tech) who resolved 42 PRs and issues. 

Since the start of the year, ECH has been steadily reducing the number of open PRS and issues to facilitate the EIP process going forward. 


## 10 Years of Ethereum, 0 downtime

We ended the month with a bang!
