### [All Core Devs - Execution (ACDE) #204](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1253) (January 30, 2025)

- **Urgent Security Update:** Geth users should [update their nodes immediately](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.14.13) to apply the latest security release.
- **Pectra Devnet-6 & Timelines:** Client teams should share [devnet-6](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/pectra-devnet-6) ready branches. If stable by **Feb 6**, testnet fork slots for **Holesky** and **Sepolia** will be selected, with client releases expected by **Feb 10**.
- **Mainnet Fork Slot Consideration:** The mainnet fork slot will be chosen only after Holesky forks successfully, likely around **Feb 20**, to avoid misleading expectations.
- **System Contract Audits Completed:** [Audits](https://github.com/ethereum/audits/tree/master/Pectra) for EIPs **2935, 7002, and 7251** were conducted by multiple firms, revealing concerns about the fee update mechanism.
- **Fusaka Fork Planning:** The first Fusaka devnet should only include **EOF and PeerDAS**, with further EIPs considered once stable. No additional decisions were made beyond this scope and that allowed teams to share their perspectives on the [Pectra Retrospective thread](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/pectra-retrospective/22637).
- **Node Hardware & Bandwidth Discussions:** [Validator bandwidth requirements](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9270) sparked debate, with no final agreement. The conversation continues on the **R&D Discord**.
- **Upcoming ACD Bot Presentation:** A new bot to automate **recordings, calendar events, and notes** for AllCoreDevs will be presented in the next call.

### Client testing call #22 (January 27, 2025)
- [Notes](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/client-testing-call-22-january-27-2025/22676)

## Breakout & Implementers‚Äô Meeting 
### [EIP-7732 breakout room #15](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1269) (January 31, 2025)
- **Client Implementation Updates:** Progress was reported on running Teku locally with ongoing issue fixes. Plans were discussed to prioritize gossip syncing, and ensures clients are ready for devnet testing.
- **Beacon API & Execution Payloads:** A new API endpoint was proposed to fetch execution payloads independently. Discussions also covered adding event stream topics to notify toolings when a new payload is received.
- **Pre-Confirmations & Potential Challenges:** The impact of Epbs on pre-confirmation mechanisms was debated, particularly concerns over a brief period where only one entity holds key information. Further evaluation is needed to assess whether this introduces centralization risks.
- **Slot Auction Research & Challenges:** Various slot auction mechanisms were discussed, including potential execution ticket designs. However, major challenges remain in implementing fork choice rules, slashing conditions, and preventing collusion.
- **Action Items for Next Meeting:** 
  - Implement new API endpoints for execution payload requests.
  - Continue improving client implementations and achieve a two-client Kurtosis run.
  - Engage with pre-confirmation teams to evaluate potential blockers.
  - Collaborate with researchers to further assess the impact of the identified "blackout period" on centralization risks.
- **Next Steps:** The team aims to finalize API updates, test implementations, and assess the viability of different approaches for pre-confirmations and execution tickets while focusing on safe, incremental improvements.

- **Client Updates:**
  - EthereumJS team completed most of the JavaScript arithmetic library.
  - Work on vectorized and non-vectorized implementations continues, with comparisons planned.
- **Poseidon Hash Implementation:**
  - Initial tests show a 10x efficiency improvement using EVM Max compared to Solidity.
  - Future work includes validating gas cost reductions and potential wall clock time improvements.
- **Vectorized vs Non-Vectorized Execution:**
  - Ongoing discussion about whether vectorized operations should be the default.
  - Need to determine end-user requirements, such as elliptic curves vs. STARKs.
- **SIMD & Hardware Compatibility:**
  - AVX2 (256-bit) is widely available, while AVX-512 has limited support.
  - Investigating impact on smaller fields where SIMD benefits could be more pronounced.
- **Tooling & Testing Pipeline:**
  - A front-end tool is needed for easier implementation testing.
  - Options include direct bytecode generation or adding support to Solidity/Ule.
- **Action Items:**
  - Confirm EVM Max gas numbers and benchmark wall clock performance.
  - Investigate SIMD comparisons using AVX2 with Poseidon hashing.
  - Develop a tool for end-to-end testing of EVM Max implementations.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Compare Solidity-based Poseidon with EVM Max implementations.
  - Refine vectorized and non-vectorized benchmarks to guide further decisions.
  - Plan for the next meeting in one month to review progress.

### Community thoughts on Public Goods Funding
There are a lot of differnt thoughts on **"Public Goods"**. Last week [Dan Robinson](https://x.com/danrobinson/status/1884338819748761840) shared his thoughts on what he considers as "Public Goods". [Vitalik Buterin](https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1884340202631471598) responded
> careful, "infra" is itself one of those words with challenging connotations üòÄ
> I'd say "funding for pure open source"

[Pooja Ranjan](https://x.com/poojaranjan19/status/1885327179778842883) thinks the Ethereum Cat Herders is one of the popular public goods projects in the Ethereum ecosystem as "Public Goods" can be many things including [essential coordination funding](https://x.com/poojaranjan19/status/1884602407029801248), [fuel for Ethereum‚Äôs progress](https://x.com/poojaranjan19/status/1884964793821389021), [an investment in Ethereum‚Äôs future](https://x.com/poojaranjan19/status/1885327179778842883) and more.
