#### EL & CL changes, PEEPanEIP, Quizzes, NFT and a Watch party invite.

The Ethereum community is expecting to activate **Pectra** on mainnet on **May 07, 2025 at epoch 364032** (10:05:11 UTC).  This is the 3rd upgrade on the post-Merge Ethereum blockchain. It is also the 19th network upgrade since the launch in 2015, probably the highest number of upgrades to an active blockchain.  

Pectra is bringing a combination of execution and consensus layer changes. The upgrade will be activated in less than 24 hours. It will introduce features such as staking exits from the execution layer, code-enabled EOAs, calldata cost adjustments, and blob throughput increases, among many others. It intends to continue the protocol‚Äôs development toward scalability, security, and decentralization.

Alongside the technical upgrades, Ethereum Cat Herders and the broader community have collaborated on educational content, including PEEPanEIP recordings, testing call summaries, NFT for Author‚Äôs Recognition and a Shapella- Dencun-style watch party to mark the occasion.

# ‚ú® Why is it called ‚ÄúPectra‚Äù?

Ethereum upgrades are named using a simple pattern: the execution layer is named after a Devcon city, and the consensus layer is named after a star. ‚Äú**Pectra**‚Äù is a mix of **Prague** (the city where Devcon IV was held) and **Electra** (a bright star in the Taurus constellation). This name shows that both layers of Ethereum are being upgraded at the same time.

# üöÄ Testnet Deployments & Incident Reports
The Pectra upgrade underwent a rigorous multi-phase testing process across Ethereum‚Äôs public testnets to ensure network readiness and client stability over several [Devnets](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Pectra/pectra-pm.md). Initial deployment on **Holesky** (Feb 24, 2025) revealed sync issues and client incompatibilities, which were promptly addressed and documented in the[ Holesky Post-Mortem](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Pectra/holesky-postmortem.md). These early findings informed critical improvements ahead of the **Sepolia** deployment (Mar 5, 2025), which encountered a known bug that was swiftly fixed‚Äîalso captured in the[ Sepolia Post-Mortem](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Pectra/sepolia-postmortem.md).

A final pre-mainnet run on the **Hoodi testnet** (Mar 26, 2025) served as the final staging ground, confirming system readiness for mainnet. Each testnet phase contributed valuable insights, reinforcing the reliability of the client releases and validator configurations.

The upgrade is scheduled for mainnet activation on May 7, 2025 at 10:05:11 UTC, following the activation plan outlined in the[ Mainnet Upgrade & Incident Response Team Plan](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Pectra/pectra-mainnet-plan.md). This phased rollout has exemplified Ethereum‚Äôs commitment to secure and transparent upgrade coordination.

## Activation Plan & Client Requirements

The Pectra upgrade is scheduled to activate on the Ethereum mainnet on May 7, 2025. To remain compatible and continue participating in Ethereum‚Äôs consensus, **node operators and validators must upgrade** both their Execution Layer (EL) and Consensus Layer (CL) clients to a Pectra-ready version. 

One notable development in this upgrade cycle is the participation of **Reth**, the latest addition to Ethereum‚Äôs Execution Layer clients, and **Grandine**, as an open-source Consensus Layer client now included in the upgrade process. 

Upgrading is essential‚Äî**nodes that do not upgrade will fork from the main network and be left on an incompatible chain**. 

Refer to the [Ethereum Foundation blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/04/23/pectra-mainnet) for complete client upgrade instructions and FAQ. Be sure to update your clients to the minimum compatible versions to remain part of Ethereum‚Äôs mainnet consensus.

# üôå Education, Community Engagement & Author Recognition
Ethereum Cat Herders championed a series of community-driven initiatives to ensure the Pectra upgrade was not only technically successful but also widely understood, celebrated, and accessible to all.

## üéôÔ∏è PEEPanEIP Series
To deepen public understanding of the [EIPs included in Pectra ](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cwHXAawZxqOHV_F40AJbzcl8b6tG8xw), we recorded detailed walkthroughs with EIP authors and client implementers. These educational discussions are part of the ongoing [PEEPanEIP series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cwHXAawZxpby7LszzOnyuAyQl8WLLvh), designed to make Ethereum protocol changes transparent and approachable.

## üìú Ethereum Protocol Progress
Ethereum Cat Herders has launched a new series titled ‚ÄúEthereum Protocol Progress‚Äù ‚Äî a curated collection of tweet threads that document each major Ethereum network upgrade. This initiative aims to make Ethereum‚Äôs evolution more accessible and understandable to the broader community. Each thread breaks down an upgrade‚Äôs Introduction, Core Features, Benefits, Community Impact, Challenges, and a Fun Fact, offering a concise yet informative snapshot of how the protocol has progressed over time. Browse the **full series** below and follow along to revisit Ethereum‚Äôs most important milestones leading to Pectra:
