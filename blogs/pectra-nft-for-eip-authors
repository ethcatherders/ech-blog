# Commemorative NFT for EIP Authors of Pectra Upgrade

We're excited to announce the launch of a special commemorative NFT, designed to express our gratitude to EIP authors who have contributed to the Ethereum ecosystem and have at least one of their EIPs included in the latest upcoming Ethereum network upgrade.

If you authored one of the EIPs in the upcoming Pectra upgrade, you're eligible to claim your NFT now on at: 

[https://www.ethcatherders.com/upgrades/pectra](https://www.ethcatherders.com/upgrades/pectra).

To claim your commemorative NFT, simply follow these steps:

1. **Verify your Github profile**: It must be the same Github username cited in the EIP(s) authored.
2. **Enter your ENS or wallet address**: The NFT is on Base so ensure you have ownership of that address on that chain. 
3. **Claim**: The NFT will be airdropped to your wallet. That's it. Gas covered by us.

This limited-edition NFT is a small token of our appreciation for your efforts. We're grateful for your participation and look forward to seeing your continued contributions to our community.
