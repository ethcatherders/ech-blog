In this PEEPanEIP recording, Pooja Ranjan, discussed [EIP-7805](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7805), also known as FOCIL with co-authors Thomas, Francesco, Julian Barnabe who are part of the Ethereum Foundation's *Robust Consensus Group*. The proposal aims to allow a committee of validators to enforce included transactions in every block. The proposal is currently in draft status and is an active discussion for the future upgrade. The main goal of FOCIL is to increase the credible neutrality of Ethereum.

He also compared [EIP-7623](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623) and EIP-7706, highlighting the potential complexities and risks of implementing the latter. The conversation ended with discussions on the future of Ethereum, the importance of openness and decentralization, and the potential for user experience improvements.
