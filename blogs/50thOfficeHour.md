# Celebrating the 50th EIP Editing Office Hour 🎉
#### A Milestone of Collaboration and Progress!

The Ethereum community runs on teamwork, new ideas, and shared standards. Today, we’re excited to celebrate a big milestone: the [50th EIP Editing Office Hour](https://github.com/ethcatherders/EIPIP/issues/377)! Let’s take a look at how it all started, thank the people who made it happen, and share what’s next.

## How It Started?

The idea of EIP Editing Office Hours was based on the **[EIP Editors' Apprenticeship Meetings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cwHXAawZxoLnTTFQjqdZwd6pVTsjDid)** introduced in November 2021 by the Ethereum Cat Herders and EIP Editor [Matt Garnett](https://x.com/lightclients). Matt helped train new contributors to become *[EIP reviewers](https://hackmd.io/@poojaranjan/EIPReviewer)*, opening the door for contributors to engage more deeply in the Ethereum ecosystem. These meetings encouraged more people to get involved and learn about editing EIPs. 

Building on the success of the apprenticeship meetings, the ***[EIP Editing Office Hour](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders/introducing-eip-editing-office-hour-9f04a95a26ba) was launched*** to provide a real-time, collaborative platform for EIP authors and potential new contributors. The office hour sessions officially began in September 2022, taking place every alternate Tuesday. 

The **goal** was simple: give contributors a chance to ask questions, get help with their EIPs, and learn about the process. Over time, these sessions have become a key part of improving Ethereum standards.

## Big Thanks to Sam Wilson 🙏 

A huge thank-you goes to [Sam Wilson](https://x.com/_SamWilsn_), who has been leading these sessions. Over the past two years, Sam has answered countless questions, reviewed hundreds of pull requests (EIPs and ERCs), and made the process smoother for everyone. Sam’s dedication has been vital to the success of these office hours, and we’re incredibly grateful for all your hard work. Thank you, Sam!

## Welcome Gajinder Singh 🤝

We’re excited to announce that [Gajinder Singh](https://x.com/Gajpower) is joining us to provide extra support for EIP Editing Office Hours. Gajinder will focus on leading sessions dedicated to reviewing EIPs only. With this added support and now three office hours per month, we aim to further reduce the number of open pull requests and better serve the community.

## Thanks to All Editors 🙌

Behind the scenes, many editors work hard to review and merge pull requests. These contributions keep Ethereum’s standards up-to-date and ready for new developments. Thanks to everyone working asynchronously to make this happen!

## Join the Office Hours 👋

The EIP Editing Office Hour is open to everyone. It’s a great place to learn about the EIP process, get your questions answered, and collaborate with others. If you’ve submitted a pull request, you can:

- Get help to understand the workflow.
- Work with editors to merge your proposal.
- Learn why a pull request wasn’t merged and how to improve it.

We also encourage you to check out the [EIP Editing Office Hour playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cwHXAawZxqnDHxOyuwMpyt5s8F8gdmO). It’s a helpful resource to understand the process and see the community in action.

## Looking Ahead 🛣

Reaching the 50th session is a big achievement, and we’re excited for what’s next. The EIP Editing Office Hour will keep growing and adapting to support the Ethereum community.
